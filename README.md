üß† tutorial_interview_LLM

This repository is a hands-on tutorial and interview-style project focused on fine-tuning and deploying a lightweight LLM (Tiny-LLaMA2) for instruction-following and debiasing tasks. It includes code for model loading, inference, and evaluation.

üöÄ Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/JackingChen/tutorial_interview_LLM.git
cd tutorial_interview_LLM
```
2. Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Load the Tiny-LLaMA2 Model

This script uses the transformers library to load the model and tokenizer from the local path:

```
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

model_path = "./tiny-llama2"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path)

```

4. Run Inference
Once the model is loaded, you can input a prompt and generate a response:

```
prompt = "Explain the concept of overfitting in machine learning."
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=100)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```
