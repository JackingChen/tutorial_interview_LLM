üß† tutorial_interview_LLM
This repository is a hands-on tutorial and interview-style project focused on fine-tuning and deploying a lightweight LLM (Tiny-LLaMA2) for instruction-following and debiasing tasks. It includes code for model loading, inference, and evaluation.

üöÄ Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository

2. Install Dependencies

3. Load the Tiny-LLaMA2 Model
The model is stored locally in the tiny-llama2/ directory. To load and run it, use the main.py script:


This script uses the transformers library to load the model and tokenizer from the local path:


4. Run Inference
Once the model is loaded, you can input a prompt and generate a response:


üß™ Testing
You can also run test_2.py to validate model behavior or test specific prompts.
